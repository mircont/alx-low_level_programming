## Project Overview

This project contains a series of C programs that demonstrate various concepts and tasks related to C programming, including printing patterns, working with numbers, and using control structures. Each program is designed to accomplish a specific task and serves as a learning resource for C programming beginners.

## Project Structure

- Root directory: C source code files for each task.
- Each source code file is named based on the task (e.g., `0-positive_or_negative.c`).
- README.md: Overview and instructions.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Unix-like OS.
- Basic understanding of C programming.

## How to Compile

```bash

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative


How to Run

To run a compiled program, use the following command:

bash

./0-positive_or_negative

Replace 0-positive_or_negative with the name of the program you want to run.



**Task 0** : Positive or Negative
This program generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

**Task 1** : The Last Digit
This program generates a random number and prints its last digit along with additional information.

**Task 2** : Print the Alphabet
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in sequence using the putchar function.

**Task 3** : Alphabet in Lowercase and Uppercase
This program prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using the putchar function.

**Task 4** : Exclude 'q' and 'e' from Alphabet
This program prints the lowercase alphabet while excluding the letters 'q' and 'e' using the putchar function.

**Task 5** : Print Single-Digit Numbers
This program prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 in sequence.

**Task 6** : Print Single-Digit Numbers Without Char Data Type
This program prints single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 without using the char data type.

**Task 7** : Print Alphabet in Reverse
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

**Task 8** : Print Hexadecimal Numbers
This program prints hexadecimal numbers (0-9, a-f) in lowercase.

**Task 9** : Print Combinations of Single Digits
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

**Task 10** : Print Combinations of Two Digits
This program prints all possible combinations of two different two-digit numbers.

**Task 11** : Print Combinations of Three Digits
This program prints all possible combinations of three different three-digit numbers.

**Task 12** : Print Combinations of Two Two-Digit Numbers
This program prints all possible combinations of two different two-digit numbers.
