# 0x08. C - Recursion


## Description

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion for various tasks. Each program corresponds to a specific task and follows certain coding requirements.


## Requirements


- The code should use the Betty style and will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The standard library is not allowed. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use _putchar.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in the header file called main.h.
- Loops are not allowed.
- Static variables are not allowed.



## Tasks


1. **She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
   - Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s)`
   - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

2. **Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams, we are together**
   - Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s)`
   - Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

3. **Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
   - Prototype: `int _strlen_recursion(char *s)`
   - Write a function that returns the length of a string.

4. **You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
   - Prototype: `int factorial(int n)`
   - Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

5. **Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate**
   - Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y)`
   - Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

6. **Inception. Is it possible?**
   - Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n)`
   - Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. **They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
   - Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s)`
   - Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

8. **Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...**
   - Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2)`
   - Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
