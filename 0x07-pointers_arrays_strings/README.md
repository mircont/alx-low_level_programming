# Project: 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project 0x07 - "Even more pointers, arrays, and strings" is a C programming project that delves deeper into fundamental concepts such as pointers, arrays, and strings. It covers advanced topics like pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and the manipulation of strings in the C programming language. The project's tasks involve implementing functions that perform various operations on memory, strings, and matrices. It challenges developers to strengthen their understanding of low-level programming in C while adhering to coding standards and constraints.

## General Info

In this project, we delve deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. We will explore concepts such as pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions to manipulate strings.


## Project Details

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h


## Tasks

1. **memset**: Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

2. **memcpy**: Write a function that copies memory area.

3. **strchr**: Write a function that locates a character in a string.

4. **strspn**: Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

5. **strpbrk**: Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

6. **strstr**: Write a function that locates a substring.

7. **print_chessboard**: Write a function that prints the chessboard.

8. **print_diagsums**: Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

9. **set_string**: Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

10. **crackme_password**: Create a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
