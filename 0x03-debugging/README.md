# Debugging Project

This project focuses on developing your debugging skills, understanding debugging concepts, and improving your ability to identify and fix issues in code. You will work on several debugging tasks, covering various scenarios and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:

### General

- Define the concept of debugging.
- Apply manual debugging techniques effectively.
- Interpret error messages accurately.


## Tasks

### Task 0: Multiple Mains

Create a test case for the `positive_or_negative()` function by adding a `0-main.c` file. This test case should verify that the function works correctly when given the input value 0. Keep in mind that you are testing the function, not implementing it.

### Task 1: Like, Comment, Subscribe

Comment out (without deleting) the part of the code that causes an infinite loop in the provided `1-main.c` file. Be sure to maintain the same line count and avoid adding or removing any lines of code.

### Task 2: 0 > 972?

Fix the program in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly identifies and prints the largest of three integers, regardless of the input values.

### Task 3: Leap year

Debug the program that converts a date to the day of the year, considering leap years. Modify the `print_remaining_days()` function to work correctly for all dates, including leap years.
