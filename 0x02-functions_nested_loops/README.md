# C Programming: Functions, Nested Loops

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops. Each program focuses on a specific task, ranging from printing characters to performing mathematical operations. Below is an overview of the tasks and the corresponding files:

## General Concepts Covered

- Nested loops and how to use them 
- Functions, their declaration, and definition
- Function prototypes
- Scope of variable
- GCC flags: `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, `-std=gnu89`
- Header files and the `#include` directive



## Tasks

### Task 0: _putchar

- Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

### Task 1: Alphabet

- Write a function that prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line. You can only use `_putchar` twice.

### Task 2: 10 x Alphabet

- Write a function that prints the lowercase alphabet 10 times, followed by a new line. You can only use `_putchar` twice.

### Task 3: islower

- Write a function that checks if a character is lowercase. Returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.

### Task 4: isalpha

- Write a function that checks if a character is alphabetic (lowercase or uppercase). Returns 1 if it is, 0 otherwise.

### Task 5: Sign

- Write a function that prints the sign of a number. Returns 1 and prints '+' if the number is positive, 0 and prints '0' if it's zero, -1 and prints '-' if it's negative.

### Task 6: Absolute Value

- Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

### Task 7: Print Last Digit

- Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### Task 8: Jack Bauer

- Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, from 00:00 to 23:59.

### Task 9: Times Table

- Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.

### Task 10: Add

- Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### Task 11: Print to 98

- Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, separated by commas.

### Task 12: Print Times Table

- Write a function that prints the n times table, starting from 0, if n is less than or equal to 15.

### Task 13: Sum of Multiples

- Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded).

### Task 14: Fibonacci Numbers

- Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, separated by commas.

### Task 15: Even Fibonacci Sum

- Write a program that finds and prints the sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4,000,000.

### Task 16: Advanced Fibonacci

- Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.

Please note that each task has its own source code file and can be compiled and executed separately.
