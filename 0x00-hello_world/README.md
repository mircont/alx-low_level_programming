## Project Description

This project is designed to help you learn and practice C programming. It covers fundamental concepts such as pre-processing, compilation, and executing C code. Each task in the project is a separate exercise that focuses on a specific aspect of C programming. The tasks include:


1. Preprocessor: Running a C file through the preprocessor and saving the result in another file.

2. Compiler: Compiling a C file without linking and saving the output as an object file.

3. Assembler: Generating assembly code (Intel syntax) from a C file and saving it in an output file.

4. Hello, puts: Writing a C program that prints a message using the `puts` function.

5. Hello, printf: Writing a C program that prints a formatted message using the `printf` function.

6. Size is not grandeur: Printing the sizes of various data types in C.

7. Intel (Advanced): Generating assembly code (Intel syntax) from a C file and saving it in an output file.

8. UNIX is basically... (Advanced): Printing a specific message to the standard error.

Feel free to explore each task and use them as learning resources or as examples for your C programming projects.




## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Navigate to the `0x00-hello_world/` directory to access the task-specific files and scripts.

3. Each task is contained in a separate file with a corresponding number (e.g., `0-preprocessor.c` for Task 0). You can compile and run the C programs according to the instructions provided in each task's description.

4. You can also explore the `Makefile` in the `0x00-hello_world/` directory for convenient compilation and execution of the C programs.
