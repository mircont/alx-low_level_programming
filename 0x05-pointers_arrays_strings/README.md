# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## General Information

The project "0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings" is a programming project that focuses on various fundamental concepts in the C programming language. The project aims to help developers understand and practice the following key topics:

Pointers: Understanding what pointers are and how to use them in C. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, and they play a crucial role in memory management and data manipulation.

### Arrays: Learning about arrays, which are collections of elements of the same data type. Arrays are widely used in C for storing and manipulating data efficiently.

### Strings: Exploring how to work with strings in C. In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters, and this project covers string manipulation and operations.

### Variable Scope: Understanding the scope of variables in C. Variables can have different scopes, such as global and local, and understanding scope is essential for proper program design.

The project comes with a set of tasks, each of which focuses on one or more of these topics. For example, tasks involve writing functions to reset the value of an integer using pointers, swapping the values of two integers, calculating the length of a string, and more. Each task is designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the project.

The project also includes specific requirements and constraints, such as using the Betty style for code formatting, avoiding the use of standard library functions like printf and puts, and limiting the number of functions per file. These constraints are in place to encourage developers to work within the specified guidelines.

Overall, this project serves as a valuable learning experience for C programmers, helping them gain a deeper understanding of pointers, arrays, strings, and variable scope in the C language. It also promotes good coding practices and adherence to coding standards.


## Tasks

### Task 0: 98 Battery St.

Write a function `reset_to_98` that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### Task 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Write a function `swap_int` that swaps the values of two integers.

### Task 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Write a function `*_strlen` that returns the length of a string.

### Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Write a function `_puts` that prints a string followed by a new line.

### Task 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear

Write a function `print_rev` that prints a string in reverse followed by a new line.

### Task 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

Write a function `rev_string` that reverses a string.

### Task 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true

Write a function `puts2` that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### Task 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Write a function `puts_half` that prints half of a string followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, print the last (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2 characters.

### Task 8: Arrays are not pointers

Write a function `print_array` that prints n elements of an array of integers followed by a new line.

### Task 9: strcpy

Write a function `_strcpy` that copies a string pointed to by `src`, including the null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

### Task 10: Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers

Write a function `_atoi` that converts a string to an integer. It should consider signs, and if there are no numbers in the string, return 0.

### Task 11: Don't hate the hacker, hate the code

Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.
